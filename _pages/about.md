# Biography

I'm a graduate student from [School of CSE](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/), [Sun Yat-Sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/) under the supervision of Assoc. Prof. Chang-Dong Wang ([Homepage](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/content/2465), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=omqnB70AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)). My research interests include graph mining, graph neural networks and recommender systems. I'm currently exploring the combination of graph foundation models with large language models or diffusion models on a variety of graph mining tasks. 



Aiming at the goal of constructing a general foundation model for the non-Euclidean structural graphs on different tasks, I'm desired to further pursue a Ph.D. in graph mining. I am looking forward to deep collaborations and high-quality academic publications with any researchers and companies that share similar research interests.



# Allminer Lab

I'm currently in the [Allminer Lab](https://github.com/AllminerLab) launched by Assoc. Prof. Chang-Dong Wang in 2013. Our lab is working on the following fields:

1. Graph data mining and its application, including graph representation learning, graph data clustering, graph-based recommender systems, etc.
2. AI4Science, especially in AI4Medication.
3. Secure Multi-Party Computation
